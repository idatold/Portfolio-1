            Whimsy & Words is a personal book blog I created to share my
            thoughts on books and authors that inspire me. The goal of the
            design was to keep things simple and clean, making it easy for
            visitors to find and read reviews. The homepage showcases recent
            posts with a focus on readability and accessibility.

            Rainy Days is a mock e-commerce site I built for a company that
            sells outdoor jackets. The goal was to create a functional,
            minimalist shopping experience that focuses on the products without
            overwhelming the user. The design is simple, with product images
            front and center, and the navigation is straightforward to make the
            shopping process smooth.

            This project is a website for a fictional Community Science Museum.
            The goal was to design a site that would be easy for users of all
            ages to navigate, with a clean layout and an emphasis on
            accessibility. The homepage introduces key sections like
            Exhibitions, Explore, and Contributions.
