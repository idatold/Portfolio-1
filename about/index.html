            I`m Ida. A photographer, problem solver and currently studying
            front-end development.

          <p class="small-text">
            The blend of creativity and technology has always been a part of who
            I am. I first fell in love with photography when I was 14, the
            moment I got my hands on my first mirror camera. From that point on,
            I was hooked — capturing the world and making sure everyone looked
            their best through my lens. <br>For many years, I worked on a ferry
            ship, balancing life at sea with my passion. I used my two weeks at
            home to dive deep into photography, editing, and creating. After 14
            years of adventures at sea, I realized it was time for a change — I
            craved something new, something that would challenge and excite me
            in the same way photography did. That’s when I found frontend
            development, and it has been a thrilling journey ever since. Now,
            after a year of immersing myself in design, coding, and the frontend
            community, I’ve found my spark again. The world of web design feels
            like the perfect playground where creativity and logic meet. With
            every line of code and every pixel perfected, I feel more alive. I
            can’t wait to continue honing my skills and dive into even more
            exciting designs and projects, creating websites and applications
            that not only look stunning but also solve real-world problems.
