            I`m Ida. A photographer, problem solver and currently studying
            front-end development.

            The blend of creativity and technology has always been a part of who
            I am. I first fell in love with photography when I was 14, the
            moment I got my hands on my first mirror camera. From that point on,
            I was hooked — capturing the world and making sure everyone looked
            their best through my lens.
          </p>
          <p class="small-text">
            For many years, I worked on a ferry ship, balancing life at sea with
            my passion. I used my two weeks at home to dive deep into
            photography, editing, and creating. After 14 years of adventures at
            sea, I realized it was time for a change — I craved something new,
            something that would challenge and excite me in the same way
            photography did. That’s when I found frontend development, and it
            has been a thrilling journey ever since.
          </p>
          <p class="small-text">
            Now, after a year of immersing myself in design, coding, and the
            frontend community, I’ve found my spark again. The world of web
            design feels like the perfect playground where creativity and logic
            meet. With every line of code and every pixel perfected, I feel more
            alive. I can’t wait to continue honing my skills and dive into even
            more exciting designs and projects, creating websites and
            applications that not only look stunning but also solve real-world
            problems.
