              I`m Ida. A photographer, problem solver and currently studying
              front-end development.

              The blend of creativity and technology has always been a part of
              who I am. I first fell in love with photography when I was 14, the
              moment I got my hands on my first mirror camera. From that point
              on, I was hooked — capturing the world and making sure everyone
              looked their best through my lens.
            </p>
            <p class="small-text">
              For many years, I worked on a ferry ship, balancing life at sea
              with my passion. I used my two weeks at home to dive deep into
              photography, editing, and creating. After 14 years of adventures
              at sea, I realized it was time for a change — I craved something
              new, something that would challenge and excite me in the same way
              photography did. That’s when I found frontend development, and it
              has been a thrilling journey ever since.

            <p class="small-text">
              Now, after a year of immersing myself in design, coding, and the
              frontend community, I’ve found my spark again. The world of web
              design feels like the perfect playground where creativity and
              logic meet. With every line of code and every pixel perfected, I
              feel more alive. I can’t wait to continue honing my skills and
              dive into even more exciting designs and projects, creating
              websites and applications that not only look stunning but also
              solve real-world problems.
